a:38:{i:0;a:4:{s:5:"title";O:16:"SimpleXMLElement":0:{}s:11:"description";O:16:"SimpleXMLElement":1:{i:0;s:3384:"<p><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/kotaku/2011/08/110812-nes.jpg" width="340" class="left image340" alt="But If You Call It an NES-001, is It Worth $13,000?"  title="But If You Call It an NES-001, is It Worth $13,000?" />Previously (on <em>Pawn Stars</em>), a <em>Halo</em> cosplayer sought $2,000 for his custom-built Spartan armor, <a href="http://kotaku.com/5825743/in-debt-halo-cosplayer-takes-his-armor-to-pawn-stars">and walked out with nothing</a>. A little snicker-inducing, but the seller kept his hubris to a minimum and seemed to show more understanding than disappointment, so I felt a little sorry for the guy. This, however, is pure schadenfreude.</p>
<p>Apparently, calling this household ubiquity an NES-001 instead of a plain old NES makes it worth $13,000. That's according to some schmoe on <a href="http://www.aetv.com/storage-wars/video/?bcpid=753904050001&bclid=901962281001&bctid=1096045289001">A&E's <em>Storage Wars</em></a>, which is about those who buy up miserable people's abandoned storage lockers and try to make more than they spent off their contents. Is there a show that more perfectly crystallizes the sorry state of our economy and our television programming?</p>
<p>Can't embed the video, but if you want to see someone get served, <a href="http://www.aetv.com/storage-wars/video/?bcpid=753904050001&bclid=901962281001&bctid=1096045289001">head here</a> and start at the 14 minute mark. Our huckster sight-diagnoses this as an NES-001, which, yes, it is. And about eleventy zillion of that model were sold in North America. He then declares "this is the first Nintendo DS built." Well ....</p>
<p>His $13,000 expectation is built on the auction of an NES and five-game lot that <a href="http://kotaku.com/5470923/mom-sells-old-nes-and-5-games&mdash;-for-13105?tag=stadiumevents">happened to contain a sealed copy of <em>Stadium Events</em></a>, one of the rarest video games of that era. Needless to say, that game was not found in this locker.</p>
<p>If you just want to cut to the chase, hit the 18:30 mark to see him get his comeuppance. Remember folks, Occam's Razor would suggest that one man's trash is in fact trash.</p>

One would think its subject, <em>Half-Life 3</em> is a no-brainer too, but Valve's still making us wait on that. This week, some <s>hippies</s> Canadians got a little tired of the foot-dragging and <a href="http://kotaku.com/5829684/fan-pleas-for-half+life-3-enter-negotiating+via+cardboard-phase">staged a protest outside Valve HQ</a>, giving us four very exploitable images. We may have to expand the finalist field to 40 for this one.<!-- %JUMP:More &raquo;% --></p>
<p>Go to town. This one really should need no instruction, nor does it require any rules. Given the subject, the images and the fact Gabe Newell is involved, I implicitly trust your judgment and your ability to bring the funny here. All of the images are in that gallery above. Remember to click on the magnifying glass in the lower right-hand corner to embiggen them for your 'shopping purposes.</p>
<p>Now the clerk shall make the third reading of the bill "The Sense of the Senate Regarding Participating in 'Shop Contests."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Create your 'Shop.<br>
2. Upload it to a free image hosting service. <a href="http://imgur.com/">I suggest imgur</a>. It's stupid simple. No account is necessary.<br>
3. <strong>This is very important: You must use the URL of the image itself.</strong> In imgur, this is the second URL it gives you after you upload the image. It's under "Direct Link (email & IM)"<br>
4. At the beginning of the comments roll, click "Start a New Thread"<br>
5. To the right of your name, select "Image."<br>
6. Paste the imgur URL in the image URL field. It's the field that says "Image URL."<br>
7. You can add editorial commentary if you want, but then just hit submit and your image will load. If it doesn't, paste the image URL as a comment.<br>
8. <strong>This is important: Keep your image size under 1 MB. It will not upload to comments if it is over that size.</strong> What's more, we're getting reports that if your 'Shop is more than 1000px tall (vertical), it won't upload. If you're getting the broken-image icon, try resizing to a smaller dimension.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an added inducement, I want to let you know I do star commenters who send in worthy/funny submissions - whether or not they're chosen for the final 20. This may not happen immediately. I usually start rounding up a gallery by the middle of the week. This is my subjective call, but I do want to recognize as many contributors as possible, and show gratitude for making this such a popular feature on weekends.</p>
<p>Now, Gentlemen, start your 'shopping!</p>

<p>Hank Chien (pictured), the arcade record holder, and Dean Saglio, the record holder for emulation play, will both meet at Richie Knucklez Arcade Games in Flemington, N.J. to try to best the 1.1 million mark on <em>Donkey Kong</em>. Both will be playing cabinets.</p>
<p>Chien triumphed in a "Kong-Off" tournament at Richie Knucklez earlier this year, and before that broke his own world record with a 1,090,400 performance at Funspot in New Hampshire. Saglio's 1,153,000 would be the world No. 1 if he set the mark on a coin-operated machine. He's seeking a space in the record books and overall arcade gaming cred with a top score on a record-book mainstay.</p>
<p>This is not necessarily a competition; Chien and Saglio are meeting in a friendly exhibition and will be supporting each other's efforts. You may catch a broadcast late Sunday morning through TwitchTV (fka Justin.tv) and <a href="http://www.patrickscottpatterson.com/">PatrickScottPatterson.com</a></p>

Naturally, that was a call to carry things to a logical extreme. What else can this man do? Clearly he needs more work. We've got Gofunaki22's homage to Ted Williams, and 19 others, inside!<!-- %JUMP:More &raquo;% --></p>
<p>Bouzi (4), Cerby (5) Cleesox (6) and schnide (18, brilliantly) took care of games with "North" in the title. AngryBeaver (2 and 3) scored a rare double-final with his box-art anthology's of Double-N's biggest roles. AcornPop (1) just said the hell with it and gave everything over to one guy,</p>
<p>DarkPenfold (8) might have put him in the one game with a script too big for North to voice every other character. Not sure I get UltraRoboNina (20)'s point, but, boobies!</p>
<p>Thing about Roth's shop (17) is when you see it, you'll shit bricks. Riddicrash (16) delivers a film I'd want to see. kyosen (11) gamifies North's entire career. I imagine this will come with some kind of peripheral. PIDT (14) gets points for the pixelation. Good work.</p>
<p>My overall finalist? Gofunaki22 (9) was a consensus No. 1. Remember, when you're listening to nothing but the best of oldies, you're listening to Nolan North. God bless you.</p>
<p>Thanks again to all who entered; see you here tomorrow.</p>

The fans had given up. The result would have no effect on the season. Nothing suggested Greg Jennings and the Green Bay Packers were about to execute the most famous come-from-ahead touchdown miracle in NFL history.</p>
<p>"Every play, I don't care if I'm up by 30 or down by 20, I will go for the score," Demetry James, who was calling the plays that day, told me later.</p>
<p>The Packers had the ball on their own one yard line with only enough time to run one last play, <em>leading</em> the New Orleans Saints by 22. So, clearly, this called for a pass out of the shotgun formation. James took the snap and immediately went right on a designed rollout, because, well, every pass is designed to roll out under this offensive scheme.</p>
<p>The cornerback came up, then stopped flatfooted, realizing only too late he'd left wide open the Packers' deadliest receiver. The one who went back into the game injured. The one with a broken leg. The one who would <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1P0yfq2wDvU">put the team on his back, and do this shit, for <em>Madden.</em></a> <!-- %JUMP:More &raquo;% --></p>
<p><em>Greg Jennnnnnnnnnings.</em></p>
<p>"You know, I was surprised he even caught the ball," said James, the gamer at the controls and the creator of probably the most-viewed <em>Madden</em> highlight ever. "All I was doing was looking for the open man. I saw he was open and threw it, and then I saw him limping and realized, that's Greg Jennings, the guy got a broken leg!</p>
<p>"There were four or five of us friends playing <em>Madden</em> that day, all of us watching, and then all of a sudden we're all dying laughing. Oh my God."</p>
<div style="float: left; width: 300px; margin: 10px 10px 0px 0px; font-size: 0.675em; color: grey); padding: 0px; font-family: Verdana;"><a rel="lytebox" href="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/9/2011/08/demetry.jpg"><img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/9/2011/08/500x_demetry.jpg" width="500" class="left image500" alt="Inside the Mind of a Demetry James, Who Put the Team on Greg Jennings' Back"  title="Inside the Mind of a Demetry James, Who Put the Team on Greg Jennings' Back" /></a> Demetry James, creator of two NFL videos that have done a combined 7 million views on YouTube, and counting.</div>
<p>After five million YouTube views, what happened next is as clear in the mind's eye as Montana to Clark, Kellen Winslow being helped off the field, or Namath running up the tunnel with his finger in the air. Playing <em>Madden NFL 10</em> in his Miami home that night, James took Jennings 99 yards for the score, then replayed it with commentary as quotable as anything <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5FR3DgKCm0">John Facenda ever uttered for NFL Films</a>.</p>
<p>In the video, Jennings ridiculously limps 85 of the yards clutching his femur, having been reinserted into the game despite suffering an injury-James says it was a broken leg-earlier. It exploited <em>Madden</em>'s old injury system, which allowed for the reinsertion of players after their injury had been diagnosed, albeit with the risk of reinjury depending on the severity. As this was a one-off multiplayer game, such risk was inconsequential.</p>
<p>At the end, with the Saints' notorious hitter Darren Sharper in desperate pursuit, Jennings manages to cross the goal line for the final, if gratuitous, score. James captured it in a multiple-angle, shaky cell phone camera highlight as his friend and defeated opponent, "Gumby," stewed and then finally quit the session. James bid him farewell with "Fuck you, Gumby!" And an Internet meme was born.</p>
<p>"It just became huge. It was really flattering to see all of the reaction, all of the comments. Some were positive, some were negative," James said. "I think Bartstool Sports was the first to notice it, and then Jimmy Kimmel tweeted about it, and then it really was huge."</p>
<p>Filmed in April 2010, the video lingered on James' YouTube account for a few months until October, when everyone, including Kotaku sister site Deadspin, noticed and picked it up. In the NFL playoffs, Jennings himself would hear trash talk from opposing defensive backs challenging him to "put da team on your back, doe." (That last word, by the way, is pronounced "doo.")</p>
<p>"I'm like, seriously, we're beating you guys really bad. Put the team on <em>your</em> back," he said.</p>
<p>When the Packers made the Super Bowl in January, Jennings was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPAeBgc4Iw0&feature=related">asked about the highlight at media day</a>. He didn't need it explained to him. "Darren Sharper!" he said, in James' voice, later reprising the highlights (sans profanity) in an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfIVFRxXKXI&feature=related">appearance on <em>The George Lopez Show</em></a> <a href="http://deadspin.com/5778631/greg-jennings-responds-to-fans-religious-experience-as-greg-jennings-on-madden?tag=gregjennings">and at Disney World.</a></p>
<p>"If I never became famous playing football," Jennings said, "he made me famous, playing <em>Madden</em>."</p>
<p>And not that he needed the help, but <em>Madden</em> has done its part for James' fame, enshrining "Put Da Team on Your Back" <a href="http://kotaku.com/5826086/madden-nfl-12-promises-one-of-the-most-hardest+hittin-achievements-in-da-league?tag=madden">as an achievement/trophy in <em>Madden NFL 12</em></a>. Take Jennings (no other receiver) 99 yards for a touchdown and the 50-Gamerscore/silver trophy prize is yours.</p>
<p>In his regular life, James, a 24-year-old Miamian, works the front desk of a property management agency and is lifelong friends with "Gumby" and others who were present in the Xbox Live party watching. They all talk trash while playing <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>NBA 2K</em> or <em>Madden</em>, which he's bought every year for the past decade.</p>
<p>But he unwittingly created a masterpiece that taps all the necessary components of an iconic highlight, in video games and sports alike. It is brief (just 90 seconds). Not only does it have a signature line, it has at least <em>eight</em>. And, of course, what it all describes is just stupefying to behold. That's what got James so excited in the first place.</p>
<div class="modfont" style="float: right; width: 280px;">
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Demetry James' call of a 99-yard catch-and-run touchdown by Greg Jennings in <em>Madden NFL 10</em></strong> has at least eight iconic lines, a career's worth for most professional play-by-play men. Here they are:<br>
• "I have one of the most best offense in Madden history."<br>
• "He put (But I put) da team on his (my) back, doe!"<br>
• "Let's go inside the mind of a Greg Jennings! (tinkly sound effect)"<br>
• "I don't know how the fuck I'm runnin' right now, doe."<br>
• "I'll do this shit, for Madden!"<br>
• "Oh shit, DARREN SHARPER!"<br>
• "One of the most hardest hittin' safeties in da LEAGUE."<br>
• And finally, "Fuck you Gumby!"</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>"When I made these videos, I didn't do it for the quotes," James said. "That's just the way I talk when I'm amped up. I don't make those up, I just record them, put them on the 'Net."</p>
<p>He followed up the Jennings performance with another kit-bashed highlight reel, calling Marshawn Lynch's real-life <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDd5DPAGoCk">"beast mode" 67-yard touchdown</a> against, lo and behold, Darren Sharper and the Saints, in the 2011 playoffs. That one has done almost two million views on YouTube, but contains about twice as much profanity and coined a term in even wider use: "Hold my dick." James says it over the replay of Lynch diving backward into the endzone, grabbing his crotch, as Sharper looks on helplessly.</p>
<p>"That's something I just made up," James says, saying he hasn't heard it elsewhere. "He was just holding his dick, saying fuck you to all of the Saints."</p>
<p>In the aftermath, James said he's become something of an Internet celebrity himself. Daily, his Xbox 360 account will see at least 10 requests to add a friend, nearly all with a personal message citing something from the Jennings video. If he's playing online and someone recognizes him, he'll be bombed with chat requests to recite one of the lines.</p>
<div style="float: left; width: 300px; margin: 10px 10px 0px 0px; font-size: 0.675em; color: grey); padding: 0px; font-family: Verdana;"><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/kotaku/2011/08/demetrygumby.jpg" width="158" class="left image158" alt="Inside the Mind of a Demetry James, Who Put the Team on Greg Jennings' Back"  title="Inside the Mind of a Demetry James, Who Put the Team on Greg Jennings' Back" /> James (left) and his friend Gumby.</div>
<p>Gumby, whose GamerTag has been seen at least 5 million times, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPFqcJws6Fc">has it even worse</a>. Thanks to his friend, Gumby's inbox is filled with fuck-yous. James says friends in the real world greet him that way, too.</p>
<p>"They don't even say 'How you doing,'" James laughed. "Not 'Hello,' not 'Good morning,' not 'hey, man, what's the score,' just 'Fuck you, Gumby.'"</p>
<center>***</center>
<p>If Jennings has, graciously, acknowledged the video, the league is unlikely to do so officially given all of the cussing and slurs in it, and James knows this. It's perhaps the only brake on his mainstream fame, given that his best work can't be featured in a family newspaper or broadcast. He's fine with that. But James does believe he's a part of NFL lore, in his own small way.</p>
<p>"I think I am," James said. "Every time somebody's watching football now, they're hoping somebody puts the team on they back, doe."</p>
<p>And do it for Madden?</p>
<p>"And do it," James laughs, "for Madden."</p>

In most cases, it covers something like online multiplayer. Not <em>Rage</em>.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Eurogamer</em>, Tim Willits, the id Software creative director, said that access to the game's underground will be restricted to those who get their copy new at retail. "You've played Rage five times. Have you found any sewer hatches?" Willits asked his interviewer. "If you bought the game new, that would be open for you. "</p>
<p>He added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You still have to download it, but you don't have to pay for it. Those hatches are all over. Most people never find them. But as soon as you do, you're like, oh. And then you start to look for it. That's our first-time buyer incentive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Willits figures this is less obnoxious than other Online Pass mechanisms because, in those instances, people know what they're missing. Not with <em>Rage</em>! "Some people will buy Rage, download that, and still never set foot in those things. They just won't. I think that's fair. It's cool," he said.</p>
<p>The sewer-system content is "outside the main path" of the game, so therefore its absence &mdash; whether one is entitled to it or not, I suppose &mdash; won't diminish the story.</p>
<p>No word if this sewer access will later be made available through a separate DLC unlock.</p>

<p>Thankfully, some of <em>Counter-Strike</em>'s most dedicated players, the professionally competitive type, are going hands-on with <em>CS: GO</em> this week at Valve HQ, giving us an early look at some of the game's big changes. <!-- %JUMP:More &raquo;% --></p>
<p><a href="http://www.eseanews.com/index.php?s=news&d=comments&id=9969">ESEA News</a>' Craig "Torbull" Levine offered up the game's first in-depth hands-on report from a "pre-beta" build of <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em>, writing that Valve is "keen on hearing the input from top [<em>Counter-Strike Source</em>] players to make <em>CS GO</em> an e-sports title."</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/bastianveiser">Bastian Veiser</a>, product manager for the ESL Pro Series, says he's also in attendance at Valve's <em>CS GO</em> playtest, writing on Twitter that it's not just <em>Counter-Strike Source</em> players offering their feedback to Valve. "There 'are' 1.6 players around," he assures fans of the other active <em>Counter-Strike</em> fanbase.</p>
<p>Levine writes that Valve plans to include both "casual and competitive games modes" in <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em> with dedicated servers and a built-in matchmaking system. The first <em>CS GO</em> map that the small group of <em>Counter-Strike</em> enthusiasts played was the iconic "de_dust," which game designer Jess Cliffe reportedly said was being "overhauled to become competitively played."</p>
<p>The next <em>Counter-Strike</em> sounds visually overhauled as well, with Levine writing that "maps look beautiful, the player skins and animations are smooth, and the gun models are cool!" Veiser tweeted that the game was apparently "based on the <em>Portal 2</em> Source engine."</p>
<p>"We got to play dust, dust2, inferno, and nuke," Levine writes, confirming the existence of the series' best known maps. Valve reportedly also confirmed that "de_train" would be included in <em>Global Offensive</em>'s map rotation among other unspecified maps.</p>
<p>The next <em>Counter-Strike</em> will also reportedly add some new weapons to its arsenal, including a "new heavy machine gun rifle, new pistols, and a new shotgun." Valve is also experimenting with two new grenade options, a pricey Molotov cocktail&mdash;designed to block rushes and do area of effect damage&mdash;and a decoy grenade that emits gunfire sounds intended to confuse players who rely on audio cues to determine player positioning. Given the controversy that surrounded the inclusion of <em>Counter-Strike</em>'s since-removed riot shield, it's going to be very interesting to see how Valve and Hidden Path integrate all-new weapons and tactics into the series' tried and tested existing components.</p>
<p>Levine also touched on the gameplay nuances of <em>CS GO</em> in his write-up, writing that the new title had a "feel" distinguishable from both <em>Counter-Strike</em> 1.6 and <em>Counter-Strike Source</em>, saying "pro players seemed surprisingly happy with the player player movement and feel of the game."</p>
<p>Valve is also reportedly experimenting with weapons that have "situational value." Instead of players committing solely to the strongest, most reliable options&mdash;the AWP, Desert Eagle, AK-47 and M4A1&mdash;it appears that the game's developers intend to make sub machine guns, shotguns and pistols viable purchases. Levine writes that <em>CS GO</em> will have "adjustable weapon variables," which sounds like an easier way for Valve to tweak values of each weapon for improved balance.</p>
<p>Finally, according to Veiser, Valve may be planning a closed, invite-only beta test for <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em> in the coming months. Attendees of this month's PAX Prime and the Eurogamer Expo (late September) will have a chance to go hands on with the game.</p>
<p><em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em> is "targeted" for an early 2012 release on the Xbox 360's Xbox Live Arcade, the PlayStation 3's PlayStation Network, Mac and PC in early 2012.</p>

Anyway ...) and in celebration of such, he's giving out a free copy of the game to all who buy it.</p>
<p>The idea is to enjoy <em>Minecraft</em> and then give a code for the game to a very special someone to let them know how you really feel about them. <em>Minecraft</em> says "Darling, I want to spend eternity with you punching livestock and digging tunnels and creating giant contraptions that launch chickens and play the Super Mario theme, until Creepers do us part." Or something.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, it's a 2-for-1 sale celebrating Notch's nuptials. Congratulations!</p>

<p>In his closing statement during last night's Republican Primary debate, Cain got all deep and insprational:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A poet once said, 'Life can be a challenge, life can seem impossible, but it's never easy when there's so much on the line."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As it turns out, those lyrics aren't the words of <em>any</em> old poet; they are the words of the immortal Donna Summer. More specifically, they're lyrics from Summer's song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqyZ1hbwWDw">"The Power of One"</a>, also known as the theme song from <em>Pokémon: The Movie 2000</em>, according to a Cain lyrics investigation by <em>New York</em> Magazine.<!-- %JUMP:More &raquo;% --></p>
<p>One can only guess as to how these lyrics wound up in Cain's head. He's quoted the song in a number of public appearances recently, and <a href="http://www.economicfreedomcoalition.com/economicfreedom-inspiration.asp?moment=17">on what appears to be the an officially endorsed website</a>, he attributes the words to "the closing song to the 2000 Olympics."</p>
<p>He's got the year right, but the beloved competitive event Cain is thinking of is a bit less "Poland vs. Sweden" and more "Pikachu vs. Snorlax."</p>
<p>Things aren't looking good for Cain in the primary&mdash;FiveThirtyEight polling maestro Nate Silver <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/24/handicapping-the-republican-field-part-ii-the-wild-cards/">currently puts him at 35-1 odds against</a>, a 2.8% chance of winning the nomination. Facing numbers like that, Cain might as well go all-out and openly court the Pokémon demographic. I'm imagining his speeches ending something like this:</p>
<p><em>"A poet once said:<br>
I want to be the very best.<br>
Like no one ever was.</em></p>
<p><em>To catch them is my real test;<br>
to train them is my cause.</em></p>
<p><em>A heart so true;<br>
our courage will pull us through.<br>
You teach me, and I'll teach you.</em></p>
<p><em>Gotta Catch 'Em All!</em></p>
<p><em>God bless you, and God bless the United States of America!"</em></p>

Once again, we're looking at <em>EVE Online</em>. An intergalactic space Ponzi scheme fleeced investors of 1 trillion spacebuxx or whatever that currency is called, which the perps can put toward a lifetime supply of game time and still have a bunch left over for all the other shit they want to buy in-world.</p>
<p>It was a plain-and-simple Ponzi scheme. About 8,000 players invested their ISK in something called Phaser, Inc, which promised returns of 5 percent per week. Some were wary of the claim but, you know, cognitive dissonance and all that. Well, the scam managers pulled the plug with this douched-up nastygram (and that image above):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a stunning period of eight months, we decided it's enough. No more new accounts. No more mails. No more payout days. No more ISK. Most likely, this will cause a lot of questions. The most important question will be answered right here, right now. The ISK is gone; you will not see it ever again.</p>
<p>You've invested it, got a chance on some profit, but it turned out to be not the best choice you've ever made. That's how investing works. At least, that's how it went for the most of you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Massively reports that the scheme did pay out 345.18 billion ISK, and wary investors withdrew 452.72 billion, but that still left over about 1.034 trillion ISK. Given that EVE's in-world currency has a real world value, this ripoff netted scammers "Eddie Lampert" and "Mordor Exuel" the equivalent of $51,677.50. It's enough to buy 2,953 30-day subscriptions or, basically, 160 years of gametime for both.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.phaserinc.com/index1.html">fund's website</a> has a full accounting of the eight month scam. They'll face no official moderation, just in-game consequences should any of their fleeced investors have the scratch to come after them. See, this is how much fun/more awesome America would be if the Libertarians actually ran things, and so we should root for that and for Ron Paul to win the Republican presidential nomination, the end.</p>

We're departing for Cologne, Germany and Gamescom 2011 on Monday, so I'd better warm up the old thumbs. Maybe with a little <em>Toy Soldiers: Cold War</em>?</p>
<p>Perhaps! I'm still catching up on (and completing) many of the Xbox Live Arcade "Summer of Arcade" titles. Bought some <em>Bastion</em> this week, still need to wrap up <em>Half Minute Hero</em> and <em>Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet</em>, but now that I have the new Toy Soldiers in my possession, my attention may drift to that new game. (I got a chance to play it for about 20 minutes at Comic-Con and quickly fell in love.)</p>
<p>I'll need to grab a few portable games for my long flight to London and the train trip to Cologne. Perhaps I'll put in one of those JRPGs I never get around to finishing.</p>
<p>What about you? Gaming plans for the weekend? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<p>According to GameSpot, which found the filing, the MSO(?) would be an environment where players' actions and choices affect the world they and everyone else inhabit. Economic systems are a good example, one Nintendo used in the filing.</p>
<p>In one case, if a player finds building materials and constructs a house, all other players would then see that house, just not its owner. Nintendo also described a concept where players gossip to an AI non-player character. who then spreads it to others in the world.</p>
<p>Finally, if players "friend" one another, they can see and interact with them in the same environment.</p>
<p>One other thing, the filing describes the game being suitable for play on something called a "Wii 3D system." This was filed last year, before the 3DS was known. While the term is eye-catching, its quite possible its either a mislabeling, our outdated information made non-operative by the 3DS and/or Wii U. It could also be legit, but this is hardly confirmation of that.</p>

They're trying to come up with sounds we've never heard before. How difficult is that? Try to imagine a sound you've never heard. See? It's nigh impossible, unless you have amazing hair.</p>

<p>History has been bent in a corrective direction by <a href="http://foxshort.wordpress.com/2011/08/10/melville/">Zynga-weary</a> game designer David Fox.</p>
<p>The brave Fox has finally brought Melville's great novel to Facebook in the form of <em>Melville</em>, a game that lets you spend a replenishing pool of points to turn each page from the tutorial of "Call me Ishmael" to the climactic boss battle between Ahab and the whale (at least I think it gets there...I haven't earned enough star points to read that far ahead).</p>
<p>It's like all <em>FarmVille</em> but with all of the complexities of <em>FarmVille</em> gameplay replaced with simple page-turning mouse-clicks.</p>
<p>Play it <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/melville/">here</a> and then share your progress with all of your Facebook friends.</p>

You'll probably see them if you play it, but if I had to list them all, I'd take a deep breath and say: A moderately tripped-out short from <em>Fantasia</em> grafted onto <em>PixelJunk Shooter</em> through the lens of <em>Limbo</em> by way of <em>Shadow Complex</em>, all wrapped up in a weirdo Dr. Seuss-gone-wrong art-style.<!-- %JUMP:More &raquo;% --></p>
<p>But of course, when I say that it channels <em>Shadow Complex</em>, I mean that it actually channels <em>Metroid</em> and <em>Castlevania</em>, because <em>Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet</em> is a "Metroidvainia" game, through and through. (I believe the fact that we still grudgingly surround the word "Metroidvainia" in quotation marks means that the term itself is never going to be more than an inelegant portmanteau. But what term to use in its place? I have no answer.)</p>
<p>Players spend much of <em>ITSP</em> flitting about in a little spacecraft that calls to mind nothing so much as Marvin the Martian's wee little flying saucer, using various upgrades to open different sections of a vast, backtrackable map. The game's defining aspect is certainly Michel Gagné's fantastic artwork, all silhouetted beasties and tentacles and ice-sculptures and deadly plant-life, lunging and swaying about the titular planet's surface. (For reference, check out <a href="http://kotaku.com/5826593/it-looks-like-metroid-starring-a-flying-saucer-but-it-plays-a-little-differently">the video that Totilo shot</a> last week.)</p>
<p><a rel="lytebox" href="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/9/2011/08/coral.png"><img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/9/2011/08/500x_coral.jpg" width="500" class="left image500" alt="Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet Takes You on a Weird, Wild Tour of Metroidvainia-land"  title="Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet Takes You on a Weird, Wild Tour of Metroidvainia-land" /></a>Despite its convoluted (and, let's be honest, overly precious) name, <em>ITSP</em> is fairly simple as Metroidvainia games go; most of the secrets, gates, and hidden upgrades aren't actually all that hidden at all. But all the same, it scratches a very specific itch, conjuring that special feeling these games give&mdash;that of gradually digging, pushing, probing; feeling out a vast, unknown space for nooks and crannies, mining for treasure and gradually mastering a complex, ever-evolving ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>And <em>ITSP</em> is nothing if not an ecosystem;</strong> a free-standing, indifferent world of burrowing monsters, giant automated drills, crystalline caverns and whirring, grinding gears. For a gameworld so ostensibly filled with life, it all feels a bit dead and cold&mdash;nothing beyond my ship's portholes seems particularly aware of me, and enemies in the game feel more like part of an automated security system than sentient foes.</p>
<div class="modfont" style="float: right; width: 190px; margin: 10px 0px 10px 25px; line-height: 0.85em; font-size: 2.55em; color: black; padding: 16px;">The entire experience doesn't conjure a space odyssey so much as a diving expedition thousands of leagues beneath the sea.</div>
<p>But in a way, that vague emptiness highlights <em>ITSP</em>'s appealing exploration aspects even more&mdash;the entire experience doesn't conjure a space odyssey so much as a diving expedition thousands of leagues beneath the sea, deep within gorges and hollows untouched by man.</p>
<p><strong><em>Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet</em> doesn't quite achieve the just-one-more-room addictiveness of some of its influences</strong>, and combat and inventory management are a bit of a chore (there are more than four buttons on the 360 controller, guys!). But the game's clever puzzles, constantly surprising variety and never-not-gorgeous art design more than make up for those shortcomings. And more to the point, like any good Metroidvainia game, it offers regular doses of that small, unquantifiable thrill: I've unearthed a new upgrade. Where can I go now?</p>
<p>From the presumed sequel to <em>Shadow Complex</em> to the coming 3DS re-release of <em>Cave Story</em>, to 3D games like <em>Darksiders</em> and <em>Batman: Arkham Asylum</em>, we sure do seem to be seeing a lot of traversable-world, exploration-based games these days.</p>
<p>An overload of any genre can quickly lead to fatigue&mdash;so many first-person shooters! Too many lengthy RPGs! But if the creepy crawly pleasures of <em>Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet</em> are any indication, I don't think I'll be getting tired of Metroidvainia games any time soon.</p>

<p>Usually that wouldn't be a problem. But <em>Age of Empires Online's</em> survival faces two challenges: It's an unequivocating real-time strategy computer game hitting during a time when the best of its ilk have shrunk away to become casual or Facebook games. It is a free game that can only survive economically if people are willing to eventually spend too much for too little.</p>
<p>So be prepared to be lied to, because I can't let this game die.<!-- %JUMP:More &raquo;% --></p>
<h2>Here's the part where I'm telling you the deep, honest-to-god, from-my-heart truth.</h2>
<p>There are a lot of things about <em>Age of Empires Online</em> that make it better than the games that came before it. But what makes me love it more than those previous versions (Yes, even <em>Age of Empires II</em>... even the <em>Rise of Rome</em> expansion) is that for the first time in my life I am the father, not the son, in the long, late-night matches I play with my family.</p>
<p>The fact that I can play with my son, while sentimental, isn't a reason unto itself for my adoration of the game, it simply highlights what's great about this new take on gathering, building and conquering.</p>

</div>
<p>I spent a few sleepless nights playing <em>Age of Empires Online</em>, offline. While technically I was still connected to the internet, I didn't have to be, well not for any meaningful, game-mechanics reason. I completely ignored the ability to play cooperatively and competitively as I played through the quests of <em>Age of Empires Online</em> as if I were tackling the campaign of one of those earlier age games.</p>
<p>While the basic mechanics of <em>Age of Empires Online</em> is fairly reminiscent of previous versions of the game, the overall approach to the game has a component of persistence that changes everything.</p>
<p>The game's new core is built around a persistent city that is home to both the game's many quest givers and the decorative spoils of war, but also things that allow you to permanently shape and augment your armies.</p>
<p>Because your capital is always there, you can't change up civilizations whenever you feel like it. Instead these civilizations, and the capitals you build are like your character in this always online game. The game is only launching with two civilizations to start with: Egyptian and Greece. I chose the former, my son the latter.</p>
<p>The capital is built up by unlocking blueprints for new buildings. These buildings allow you to do things that provide permanent bonuses to your armies, and even new units. It's also where, as you level up through quests, that you will build out your tech tree using earned points. The tech tree does things like giving a bonus to your walls, or making your spearmen a bit more dangerous. Once activated, these all come into play every time you do a quest. There are also advisers that you can assign to your civilization that offer massive bonuses. One, for instance, gives all of my soldiers the ability to slowly heal over time without a priestess.</p>
<p>So this capital isn't just eye candy, it's the realization of the way you've decided to shape your civilization. Because of it no two Egyptian or Greek civs are alike or at least there is an enormous amount of variety. But this is all of the back-end stuff, the tweaks to your civ that make your armies more about distance attacks, or cavalry or maybe you're all about turtling. That's something you could always do in the past, but now those choices are augmented with your capital and how you built it out. It's a massive difference.</p>
<div style="width:620px; height:496px; background-image:url('http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/kotaku/2011/08/spartan_2011-08-12_13-27-00-29_01.jpg')"></div>
<p>The gameplay, what <em>Age of Empires</em> players will know and love, is all built around competitive matches and quests. I've spent an enormous amount of time playing through the quests. Each is assigned by different folks in your town and they range from traditional, beat-the-bad-guys matches to survival, to having to find missing units and save them. When you drop into a quest it's like dropping into a level in an old <em>Age of Empires</em> game, but with a significant difference. Your overall level, the one tied to your capital, impacts what you have access to. Early on it means very limited troop selection. By level nine I was able to make camel riders, slingers, axe and spear men, as well as a priestess for healing and a defensive tower, walls and gates.</p>
<p>But there are still plenty of things still left to be discovered.</p>
<p>Ian Vogel, design lead at Microsoft Game Studios, told me in a recent meeting that the quests were designed to also give players early access to some of that high level content just to whet their appetite to play.</p>
<p>I saw that a few times as I slowly ranked up. One level gave me a band of archers, another high level priests, a third swordsmen, all units I would eventually unlock, but not until the high levels. It also kept me interested in the game, because I ended up wanting to be able to make those units on the fly.</p>
<p>Vogel tells me that <em>Age of Empires Online</em> was deeply influenced by <em>Age of Empires II</em>. The core of the game came from <em>Age II</em>, he said.</p>
<p>"<em>Age II</em> was a fan favorite," he said. "This franchise has been in our family for a long time. We liked that bit of gameplay. We have some elements from other games like <em>Age of Mythology</em>, too."</p>
<p>In particular, Online includes consumable items, which are meant to be a bit like God Powers. These items, which can be unlocked over time, allow you to do things like call in a unit of bandit archers or other sorts of back up. Another important thing you can unlock are items for your units, equipping their three slots with things that can power them up. The game has nearly 175 different consumables and more than 1,300 pieces of equipment that can be found, Vogel said. Everything&mdash;advisors, consumables, designs and equipment&mdash;can be common, uncommon, rare and epic, sort of like what you might find in a game like <em>Diablo</em>.</p>
<p>Each quest map also has two hidden treasure chests. They're always protected and typically hidden, but if you scour the map, you can typically defeat their guards and take home a bit of extra loot.</p>
<p>And then there is the ability to play skirmishes against your friends and family. Or to play most of the quests again cooperatively or in "elite" mode. The coop is a blast to play, as I've discovered with my son. Vogel tells me that he's heard about a lot of people playing with their children.</p>
<p>"Our executives at the highest level are playing with their kids," he said.</p>
<div style="width:620px; height:348px; background-image:url('http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/kotaku/2011/08/age_of_empires_iii_the_asian_dynasties_20070625104751157_02.jpg')"></div>
<p>Some hardcore fans of the franchise might be turned off by the game's use of the word social, but it's not implemented in a way that hurts the gameplay. The other ding the game seems to be getting from some old fans of the series is the game's look, which I personally love.</p>
<p>It's certainly not the old, dramatically beautiful look of the original <em>Age of Empires</em> titles. By <em>Age of Empires III</em>, the graphics were one of the biggest draws of the game.</p>
<p>Instead, the graphics look more like something you'd expect to see featuring Asterix and Obelix, than nitty-gritty, tough-as-nails strategy combat. But I happen to be a huge fan of Asterix and that art style, so I'm OK with it.</p>
<h2>And now for the part where I'm going to lie through my teeth at you. Be prepared.</h2>
<p>I mentioned that you'll need to be online, even when you don't seem to get much out of that persistent connection. That's very true. I could say that it bothers me that when I lose a connection, no matter what I'm doing, I lose everything I built up to in a particular quest. Or I could say how it's annoying that when the servers are offline (the game is still in beta, so it's happened.) I can't play a little match on my own or tinker with my city. But really, those are features right? I mean they'd have to be.</p>
<p><em>Age of Empires Online</em> isn't entirely free to play either, of course. It needs to make money for Microsoft after all. So here's how that works: Fortunately, this is all very simple and straight-forward so it shouldn't confuse you.</p>
<p>The game launches with two civilizations, Egypt and Greece. Both can be played for free online, with and against friends. But, if you want to use rare and epic gear, or advisors, or fully unlock that civ's tech tree or if you want to play ranked matches against friends, (unranked is fine.) or if you want extra inventory slots, more workshops, crafting halls, the ability to spend empire points at the in-game stores, you're going to probably want to buy a premium civilization pack. That means you pay $20 to unlock all of that for the civ of your choice.</p>
<div style="width:620px; height:272px; background-image:url('http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/kotaku/2011/08/packs_01.jpg')"></div>
<p>What are empire points, you ask? Why they're one of three currency systems in the game. Isn't having three currency systems in the game, none of which are tied to real cash, confusing? No, not at all. You spend gold on the stuff you build in your town. You spend empire points on the stuff you buy at stores and you spend Spartan coins at the stores in sparta, where the ranked player-versus-player matches occur... at least I think that's right.</p>
<p>While the game is launching with two civs, others are already on the way, due out by the end of the year. Those others include two more civs and a booster pack.</p>
<p>What's a booster pack? I'm glad you asked.</p>
<p>The only one we know about is Defense of Crete, which sounds essentially like horde mode for <em>Age of Empires</em>, which is really cool and only costs an extra $10.</p>
<p>But wait, there's more.</p>
<p>Empire extras will run you $5 a pop if you care to indulge. Available at launch will be decorative shrubbery for both civs as well as ornaments and statues.</p>
<p>And still more.</p>
<p>If you want you can buy a Pro Civilization pack for $20. This is essentially like the other civ packs but instead of just giving you all of those goodies we went over earlier, it jumps you straight to level 20 in the game.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Microsoft seems to realize that all of these options to buy may be a bit baffling. So they've come up with a solution.</p>
<p>That solution is called the Season Pass. For a mere $100 you get all of the premium content from the game for the first six months at no extra charge. So $100 buys you the complete <em>Age of Empires Online</em>... for six months. After that you get to keep the content, but have to pay for anything new that you want when it comes out.</p>
<h2>And now back to reality and all of those shades of grey.</h2>
<p>It is a great game, a game that takes a classic, well-built interface and mechanic for real-time strategic war, and places a level of persistence on top of it that isn't just meaningful, it actually works. The fact that I have to level up each civilization separately might seem like a bad thing to some, but I actually like the challenge and the idea that once I'm finished with Egypt, I can move on to Greece, and whatever else they have in the pipe.</p>
<p>It does have some minor annoyances. I pointed out to Vogel that I found the path-finding a bit hinky at times. Vogel was surprised to hear that.</p>
<p>"The path-finding engine's core came from <em>Age II</em>," he told me. "This is an engine that has been iterated over time. This is ten years of path-finding iteration that works well."</p>
<p>When I pressed him about possible fixes to those path-finding hiccups, which I really did find mostly minor, he said that wasn't going to happen.</p>
<p>"Changing path-finding at this point is a terrifying thing," he said. "That's a year of bug farms."</p>
<div style="width:620px; height:272px; background-image:url('http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/kotaku/2011/08/sparta_superbirdseye_01.jpg')"></div>
<p>But that doesn't mean work on the game stops now. This is a living world, with content meant to be rolled out for at least the next two years.</p>
<p>And what about the Romans? They're one of my personal favorites. Vogel couldn't make any promises, but he said that the team is aware of how popular that particular civilization is.</p>
<p>My final question fell back on my insecurities for this game. It's a game I want to get invested in, that I want to stick around. So what will mark it a success in Microsoft's eyes, I asked Vogel.</p>
<p>"Money is just a piece of this," he said. "Microsoft also wants to create a community. They want people to connect through Live, and then stick around for six months, eight months, a year.</p>
<p>"We want players to be understanding that we are creating something new. We want to make our money back and a profit, but what matters more is creating good will and building a community."</p>
<p>My hope is that Microsoft simplifies the business model a bit, and the in-game economy. I'd also hope that gamers who've tried and like <em>Age</em> before not judge this latest iteration by its art. Love the art or hate it, the guts of this game are dazzling.</p>
<p><em>Age of Empires Online</em> is due out Aug. 16 for free only on Games For Windows Live. (When asked about Steam, Vogel said that it was a great platform, but that Live is their current focus.)</p>

<p>We could have done melee weapons, but the one thing I hate about melee weapons, and guns as well, is that the human brain is encoded to expect recoil from those things," Molyneux explained.</p>

<p>The alternative, then, is magic, for which we have none of said encoded expectations. I suppose that's okay. I don't think I'll miss swords or guns all that much when I'm wielding thunderbolts between my bare hands.</p>

It's got a few twists that are going to throw any <em>FrontierVille</em> fan for a loop.</p>
<p>But it also has hints of where the people who made it at Zynga might be going... directions that any hardcore gamer should pay attention to. <!-- %JUMP:More &raquo;% --></p>
<p><strong>For <em>FrontierVille</em> fans:</strong> <em>Pioneer Trail</em>, formerly called <em>Oregon Trail</em> before a name change due to a competing game with that name, is an extension of <em>FrontierVille</em> that can be played as a standalone game. It's supposed to launch some time today, August 12.</p>
<p>Series veterans will be able to import your coins, horseshoes, spouse and kids to <em>Pioneer Trail</em>, enjoying whatever benefits you have accrued in the original game. But you will be leaving that family behind in the new game to embark on a story-driven adventure: you set out on a trail to rescue a kidnapped boy. You can magically transport to your family's homestead to check in on them, but the meat of the game is on the trail as you strive to rescue the kid. Your adventure will span a handful of zones, from the forest-filled Beaver Valley through to the snowy Avalanche Pass, each a place where you can gather resources, do jobs and find story notes that push the plot forward. The whole adventure is supposed to take 2-4 weeks to complete.</p>
<p><a rel="lytebox" href="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/9/2011/08/high_plains_2.jpg"><img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/9/2011/08/500x_high_plains_2.jpg" width="500" class="left image500" alt="FrontierVille Sequel Pioneer Trail Gets Zynga a Little Closer to Making Hardcore Games, Limits Friends"  title="FrontierVille Sequel Pioneer Trail Gets Zynga a Little Closer to Making Hardcore Games, Limits Friends" /></a><em>And here's the twist:</em> You can only bring three friends with you for the ride. That's right. Forget about most of your so-called Facebook "friends." You will be bring just three Facebook folks into your game, one to be the hunter, one the doctor and one the carpenter. Each will be able to provide you with a resource&mdash;meat, medicine, parts&mdash;and each will be able to go on specific jobs. A Zynga rep told me that they limited the number of friends you can connect to in order to ensure that interactions with friends feel like the most powerful interactions possible in the game. Friends need to matter. And they'll need to be reliable, hopefully, as <em>Pioneer Trail</em> will let friends visit each other's games three times a day, helping their pals amass the resources and energy to proceed in this traditional Zynga-style resource management type of game.</p>
<p><strong>For Facebook-game-shunning skeptics (aka many hardcore gamers who prefer the kind of stuff you can play on an Xbox 360 or through Steam):</strong> Pay attention to what Zynga is doing. They're not just making more and more resource-management click-a-thons. Their recently-released <em>Empires & Allies</em> added a light layer of strategic combat to their usual formulas. <em>FrontierVille</em> is set to add a lot more elements that might sound familiar:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Multiplayer Matchmaking:</em> If <em>Pioneer Trail</em> players can't or don't want to play the game with their Facebook friends, they'll be able to make the game find them a person of similar rank to play with.</li>
<li><em>Branching Narratives:</em> The storyline in <em>Pioneer Trail</em> partially unfolds as the player completes tasks and finds story notes. There are more in the game than can be found in one playthrough, Zynga tells me. But more interesting than that is that sometimes there will be choices that affect what we learn next in the story. Having not been able to play the game myself yet, the impression I got from Zynga is that player choices won't be that deep&mdash;you're choosing whether to chase a butterfly or not, for example&mdash;but that they will affect how the narrative unfolds. I'm sensing very vague shades of the branched narratives popular in role-playing games from the likes of BioWare.</li>
<li><em>High Scores:</em> Playing for points might be a bit retro these days, at least among players of most blockbuster console games, but it's still a hallmark of a type of game that Zynga skeptics respect. <em>Pioneer Trail</em>, unusual for Zynga, can be played for points. Players will be scored on how they play through each of the game's major areas and will get an overall score for a playthrough of the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these <em>Pioneer Trail</em> features will be implemented with the depth a hardcore gamer might expect, but the do move Zynga closer to making games that function in the way that a lot of long-term gamers will recognize. It doesn't seem like Zynga's about to announce a competitive first-person shooter or role-playing game or anything, but one can easily imagine how such features could nudge them towards some of the rhythms of solo and multiplayer gaming that their prior work has avoided.</p>
<center>***</center>
<p>What to make of <em>Pioneer Trail</em>? It's uncommon for Zynga to make a spin-off to one of its games. It's uncommon for them to ask us to play video games with so <em>few</em> people. And it's uncommon to borrow these many traits from the kind of games they don't usually make in one go.</p>
<p><em>Pioneer Trail</em> launches today (presumably via <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/frontierville"><em>Frontierville</em>'s main Facebook page</a>). Let's see what Zynga's millions of gamers think of it and what the outside crowd does too.</p><div class="feedflare">

Are they on to something?</p>
<p>The Iron Wolf speculation comes after hackers gained access to the Xbox Live account of an internal PartnerNet gamertag which appears to belong to an employee at <em>Call of Duty</em> developer Treyarch. Flipping through braindx0's friends list, they noticed a number of friends playing a game labeled as Iron Wolf. Their assumption, fueled by the fact that one of the maps being played in Iron Wolf shared a name with a map from <em>Black Ops</em>, is that these people were playing <em>Call of Duty 9</em>, code named Iron Wolf.</p>
<p>The assumption strikes me as highly unlikely. The idea of a group of developers playing an upcoming game on a public network before the previous version has hit the market is ridiculous, especially when the franchise in question is <em>Call of Duty</em>.</p>
<p>What could they be playing? That requires more speculation. With a map name shared with <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops</em>, they could just be testing tweaks for that game. With the Iron Wolf code name sharing initials with Infinity Ward, they could be playing an early build of <em>Modern Warfare 3</em>, perhaps for comparison to the Wii version of <em>Modern Warfare 3</em>, developed by Treyarch.</p>
<p>And of course, I have to accept the possibility that sure, it could be <em>Call of Duty 9</em>. I'm 90 percent certain it isn't, but I have to allow. The Activision spokesperson I contacted about the story could only give me "Activision does not comment on rumors or speculation," so until they prove otherwise, there's always a chance.</p>

Hurricanes and tropical storms takes lives, ruin homes, and have been known to commit large portions of poorly-fortified cities to the briny deep. Predicting these destructive forces of nature is no game, only now it is.</p>
<p>Weather Decision Technologies, a world-leader in weather detection, alerting, and forecasting, has just entered the iOS game business with <em>Hurricane Weatherman</em>, "the World's First Reality Weather Game." I won't begrudge them that proud title, as I've never before experienced a game in which players advance up a leaderboard for predicting the when and where of actual tropical weather systems.</p>
<p>Weather wizards need only download the free app from iTunes and register in order to join in on the fun-ish-ness. Once in the game, they'll be able to submit their guesses as to when tropical storm systems will form, what they'll be named, and if they'll touch down on U.S. soil. Players can change their guesses at any point up to the day the next storm is named, so staying on top of the weather situation in the North Atlantic will be important for those hoping to rise to the top of their class.</p>
<p>When the season ends and the (hopefully figurative) smoke clears, the player at the top of the leaderboards gets his very own warm and fuzzy feeling, and the knowledge that his powers of prediction might have saved lives were he not busy playing games on his iPhone. Yay.</p>

<p>When a monster appears on the playfield in <em>Final Fantasy XIII-2</em> a Mog Clock pops up on the screen, granting the player various bonuses based on how long it takes them to make contact with the enemy. You can see examples of the Mog Clock in action in the screenshots above, as well as some of the Moogle-related fun that occurs outside of battle. Looks like we get to toss Moogles about like adorable little footballs, something I approve of wholeheartedly.</p>
